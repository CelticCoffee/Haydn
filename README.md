# Haydn

Piano. Push. Play. micro site

* Interim work published at http://celticcoffee.github.io/Haydn/
* Uses git large file storage (https://git-lfs.github.com/)

# Development plan

This site will be developed by Wendy Goodwin and Al Zimmerman with design by Brent Bacheller

Altho the design may not call for all of Boostrap's power and complexity, we want to increase our facility with the library so we'll try that first.

The size of the high-resolution images and video assets may require a more nuanced approach to asset loading. The first milestone is just to prototype the site with low-res images to validate the design.

## Milestones

0. Scaffold site (complete)
1. Code-based prototype of Photoshop mockup (underway)
2. Full resolution, wide screen site
3. Mobile site
